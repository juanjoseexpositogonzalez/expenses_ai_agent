# Join the Community

Learning is more effective with a community. Before diving into code, take a moment to connect with your fellow cohort members.


## Community Setup

- [ ] Join the cohort's Discord/Circle community
- [ ] Introduce yourself in the introductions channel
- [ ] Share what you're hoping to learn from this cohort


## Collaboration Tips

**Ask questions early.** If you're stuck on a concept, others probably are too. Your question helps everyone.

**Share your wins.** Did you get a test to pass? Found an elegant solution? Share it! Small wins compound.

**Review others' work.** Reading how others solve the same problem teaches you patterns you might not have discovered on your own.


## Getting Help

When asking for help, include:

1. What you're trying to accomplish
2. What you've tried
3. The specific error or unexpected behavior
4. Relevant code snippets

This makes it much easier for others to help you effectively.


## Ready?

Once you're connected with the community, proceed to environment setup.
